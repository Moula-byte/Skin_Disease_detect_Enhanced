## 🩺 Skin Disease Diagnostic App

A full-stack, interpretable AI-powered web application for skin disease classification using deep learning and Grad-CAM visualization. Designed for clinical usability, safety, and trust.

---

### 🚀 Features

- ✅ Upload skin lesion images for diagnosis  
- ✅ Predict disease class using a trained CNN model  
- ✅ Visualize model attention with Grad-CAM overlays  
- ✅ Input patient metadata: name, age, lesion location  
- ✅ Live image preview before submission  
- ✅ HMNIST dataset selector with sample visualization  
- ✅ Confidence-based warnings for low-certainty predictions  
- ✅ Robust input validation (numeric age, alphabetic name)  
- ✅ Prediction logging to CSV for audit trail  
- ✅ Clean, responsive UI with soft clinical styling  

---

### 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)  
- **Model**: TensorFlow / Keras CNN  
- **Visualization**: Grad-CAM via OpenCV & Matplotlib  
- **Data**: HMNIST CSV variants (8×8 and 28×28, RGB and grayscale)

### 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/skin-disease-app.git
   cd skin-disease-app
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment**  
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Place your trained model**  
   Save your Keras model as `skin_disease_model.h5` in the root directory.

5. **Add HMNIST datasets**  
   Place the following CSV files in a folder named `datasets/`:
   - `hmnist_8_8_L.csv`
   - `hmnist_8_8_RGB.csv`
   - `hmnist_28_28_L.csv`
   - `hmnist_28_28_RGB.csv`

6. **Create static folder**  
   ```bash
   mkdir static
   ```

### 🧪 Usage

1. Upload a skin lesion image  
2. Enter patient name (letters only), age (numeric), and lesion location  
3. Select a HMNIST dataset to visualize a sample  
4. Click **Predict**  
5. View:
   - Predicted disease label
   - Confidence score
   - Grad-CAM visualization
   - Patient metadata
   - Downloadable overlay image

---

### 🧰 Logging Format

Each prediction is logged to `prediction_log.csv` with:
- Patient Name  
- Image Filename  
- Predicted Label  
- Confidence  
- Age  
- Lesion Location  
- Timestamp  

---

### ☁️ Deployment Options

- **Render**: Easy GitHub integration  
- **Azure App Service**: Scalable and secure  
- **Docker**: Containerize for AWS/GCP/Azure  
- **Gunicorn**: Use for production-grade serving

---

### 📌 Validation Rules

- **Patient Name**: Must contain only letters and spaces  
- **Age**: Must be a number between 1 and 120  
- **Image**: Must be a valid image file  
- **Dataset**: Must be selected from dropdown
